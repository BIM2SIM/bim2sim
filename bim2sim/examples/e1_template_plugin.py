    #     common.CheckIfc,
    #     common.CreateElements,
    #     bps.CreateSpaceBoundaries,

    # ]
    # This means that these 7 tasks are performed when not using interactive

    # interactive mode). For detailed information about the different tasks
    # please have a look at their documentation.

    project = Project.create(

    # Next to the plugin that should be used we can do further configuration
    # by using the `sim_settings`. `sim_settings` are meant to configure the
    # creation of the simulation model and assign information before starting
    # the process. This can be either weather data files, default simulation
    # time of the created model but also what kind of enrichment should be used
    # or what elements are relevant for the simulation. For more information
    # please review the documentation for `sim_settings`.

    # Let's assign a weather file first. This is currently needed, even if no
    # simulation is performed
    project.sim_settings.weather_file_path = (
            Path(bim2sim.__file__).parent.parent /

    # Assign relevant elements
    # TODO this is currently not true, as we need to use TEASERTemplate,
    #  we need to solve #511 and #583 first
    # The template plugin uses the BaseSimSettings which don't have any
    # relevant elements defined. This means without overwriting the
    # `relevant_elements` setting, no bim2sim elements will be created.
    # Let's assign all `bps_elements` and the `Material` element. This way
    # the IFC will be searched for all IFC entities that should be mapped into
    # the classes defined in `bps_elements` and in the class `Material`.
    # For further information about the elements structure and the mapping
    # procedure please read the `elements` documentation
    project.sim_settings.relevant_elements = {*bps_elements.items, Material}

    # Assign the enrichment for use conditions of thermal zones.

    # bim2sim allows to enrich the use conditions, e.g. how many persons are
    # in a room at what times. For this we are using the data and profiles
    # provided by DIN 18599. To assign the correct enrichment to specific
    # rooms/thermal zones, we need to match these to the conditions provided
    # by DIN 18599. bim2sim automatically does some matching based on regular
    # expressions, translations, pre-configured mappings and the existing room
    # information in the IFC, but this doesn't cover all cases. Especially
    # if rooms are named "room 1" or similar and no further usage information
    # is provided by the IFC. In this case user input decisions will be
    # queried. To reduce these queries, we can set pre-configured .json files
    # to match the room names to usages via `sim_settings`.
    # The `sim_setting` `prj_custom_usages` allows to specify the path to the
    # .json file that holds the mapping.

    # As the IFC we are using has an attic which is identified by its
    # IfcLongName and the commonUsages mapping as Living space. Let's assume
    # this attic is used as a private gym because our residents are quite fit
    # people. We can assign a different usage by simply creating a customUsages
    # file and assign the usage type "Exercise room" to the room type
    # "Galerie". We already stored the .json file under the test resources,
    # have a look at it.
    # In the next step we assign this file to the project by setting:
    project.sim_settings.prj_custom_usages = (Path(
        bim2sim.__file__).parent.parent / "test/resources/arch/custom_usages/"
            "customUsagesAC20-FZK-Haus.json")

    # If we don't want to use the standard data for usage conditions, we
    # can change them. We created a project specific UseConditions file for
    # this in the test resources section. In this we assume that our residents
    # like to sleep at quite cold conditions of 16 Â°C. So we adjusted the
    # "heating_profile" entry. We leave the data for the other usages
    # untouched.

    # Let's assign this use conditions file:
    project.sim_settings.prj_use_conditions = (Path(
        bim2sim.__file__).parent.parent / "test/resources/arch/custom_usages/"
            "UseConditionsAC20-FZK-Haus.json")

    # By default bim2sim tries to calculate the heating profile based on given
    # information from the IFC. As the used IFC has information about the set
    # temperature, we need an additional `sim_setting` to force the overwrite
    # of the existing data in the IFC.
    project.sim_settings.setpoints_from_template = True

    # Before we can run the project, we need to assign a DecisionHandler. To
    # understand this, we need to understand why we need such a handler.
    # Decisions in bim2sim are used to get user input whenever information in
    # the IFC are unclear. E.g. if the usage type of a room can't be
    # identified, we use a decision to query the user what usage the room has.
    # As we don't know at which point a decision comes up, we are using
    # generators and yield to iterate over them. If you want to understand
    # deeper how this works, have a look at the decision documentation.
    # For usage as console tool, we implemented the ConsoleDecisionHandler,
    # which we are going to assign in the next step.
    # There are multiple ways to run a project. One is to use the run_project()
    # function and assign which project to run and which decision handler to
    # use. In our case this is:
    run_project(project, ConsoleDecisionHandler())

    # After the project is finished, we can review the results. As we don't
    # create any simulation model with the template Plugin, our results are
    # mainly the identified bim2sim elements and the enriched data in this
    # elements. Let's get the created bim2sim elements. Everything that is
    # created by the different tasks during the runtime is stored in the
    # playground state. The playground manages the different tasks and their
    # information. To get the bim2sim elements, we can simply get them from the
    # state with the following command:
    b2s_elements = project.playground.state['elements']

    # Let's filter all ThermalZone entities, we can do this by a loop, or use
    # a pre-build function of bim2sim:
    all_thermal_zones = filter_elements(b2s_elements, 'ThermalZone')

    # Let's print some data about our zones and review the enriched data for
    # our zones:
    for tz in all_thermal_zones:
        print('##########')
        print(f"Name of the zone: {tz.name}")
        print(f"Area of the zone: {tz.net_area}")
        print(f"Volume of the zone: {tz.volume}")
        print(f"Daily heating profile of the zone: {tz.heating_profile}")
        print('##########')

    # We can see that our provided heating profiles are correctly taken into
    # account. The enriched thermal zones now hold all information required for
    # a building performance simulation. For complete examples with model
    # creation and simulations please go the examples of the plugins.
