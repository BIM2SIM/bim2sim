# This config file is locked in here so that unit tests can use it
# The actual math_diff config file can be adjusted without concern of breaking unit tests
#
# MathDiff configuration file.  Format is:
# <unit>,<aggregation>,<delta_type>=<threshold_value>
# <unit>,<aggregation> = <absolute_threshold>,<relative_threshold>
#
#  <unit> is C, W, kWH, etc. - is unitless, * is wildcard
#  <aggregation> is Hourly, Monthly, etc. * is wildcard
#  <absolute_threshold> is an absolute threshold value
#  <relative_threshold> is a straight multiplier, not a percent.
#    -- if -1 is used, then the diff engine should _ignore_ this threshold and base the diff on just the absolute diff
#  Wildcard is * and - is for unitless quantities, e.g., ratios.
#  Defaults and overrides work the way you would think for aggregations,
#  although you can default either aggregation or both unit and aggregation, not just unit.
#  Alphas are case sensitive.
#
# Default thresholds
*, * = 0.001, 0.005
# Temperature specific thresholds (-1 means don't base diffs on relative threshold _at all_, just abs diff)
