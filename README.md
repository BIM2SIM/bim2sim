bim2sim ist eine Bibliothek um BIM Modelle aus dem .ifc Format f√ºr unterschiedliche Simulationstools aufzubereiten.
Die grundlegende Struktur des Projekts ist hier dargestellt:

## Install

tbd.

During development make sure your PYTHONPATH knows 
where to find bim2sim and plugin folders.

## Quick start

Bim2sim consists of three main objects:
- `Project`s, which wrap inputs like IFC files, intermediate states nd results
- `Task`s, which define a specific task and are executed from within a project
- `Decision`s, which occur during Task execution 
  if additional information is required from the user

### Command line

CAUTION: Until bim2sim is properly installed as python package, 
you have to be specific with paths. In the following our working directory is 
considered to be parent folder of `/bim2sim`.

show help

    python bim2sim -h

create new project

    python bim2sim project create path\to\project -o

then set backend in `path\to\project\config.ini` and copy an IFC file to `path\to\project\ifc` manually.
Or create new project with specific simulation tool and ifc

    python bim2sim project create path\to\project -s hkesim -i path\to\some.ifc

When your project setup is done, type

    python bim2sim project load path\to\project

to start/load the project. 
During the project execution you will be prompt to answer several `Decision`s.
After the project has completed, you can find the results in `path\to\project\export`.

### Import code

You can use `bim2sim` like this:

```python
from bim2sim import Project

PROJECT_PATH = "path/to/project"
IFC_PATH = "Path/to/some.ifc"

project = Project.create(PROJECT_PATH, IFC_PATH, 'hkesim')

def get_answer():
  return 42

for decisions in project.run():
  for decision in decisions:
    # replace this with your logic to get answers
    print(decision.question)
    decision.value = get_answer()
