bim2sim is a library to create simulation models for different purposes based on BIM models in the IFC format. The project is based on a base code that provides the possiblity to map the IFC data into a uniform meta strucuture. This structure can then be used to create simulation models for different purposes which is done by plugins. The corresponding project BIM2SIM (see founding section below) adressed the following four domains:

* Building Performance Simulation (BPS)
* Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC)
* Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
* Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) 

The focus of the currently released tool is on BPS and HVAC but we already provide basic methods for CFD and LCA as well. The base structure is shown below:

## Installation and Usage
You can find detailed documentation and description how to install and to use in our [documentation](https://bim2sim.github.io/bim2sim//development/docs/overview.html). We recommend reading at least:
* [Big Picture](https://bim2sim.github.io/bim2sim//development/docs/overview.html)
* [Installation](https://bim2sim.github.io/bim2sim//development/docs/installation.html)
* [First Steps](https://bim2sim.github.io/bim2sim//development/docs/first-steps.html)

For questions like why we don't use pip and if we support docker we refer to the linked documentation.

## Upcoming Features:
bim2sim is still under heavy development and you can find a lot of features that we want to improve or implement inside the issue section. Anyway here are some of the major ones that we plan to implement:
* [ ] release of an interactive webtool that has its own inbuilt IFC viewer to support decision making along the model geenration process
* [ ] interactive visualization of hydraulic networks graphs for HVAC part 
* [ ] implementation of curtain walls for BPS part
* [ ] support of AHU and ventilation simulations with Modelica
* [ ] automated integration of weather files based of location of building
* [ ] ... have a look at the [https://github.com/BIM2SIM/bim2sim/issues](issues)
