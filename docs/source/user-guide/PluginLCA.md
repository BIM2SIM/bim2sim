# PluginLCA

The PluginLCA is used to export the material quantities and their cost groups according to DIN276. Its the most basic
Plugin currently. The result are two .csv file that hold information about the used materials quantities in volume and
mass and lie the foundation for a later analysis with LCA databases. We are planning to automate this link so a complete
automated LCA can be carried out based on the IFC data.

## Structure of the plugin

The following figure shows the structure of the LCA plugin. Here you see which tasks are used and how they are combined.
