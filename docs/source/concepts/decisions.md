# Decisions

Decisions are used for missing or unclear information in the IFC which needs to
be validated or entered by the user. There are different kind of decisions
for lists to select from, just bare real inputs etc. In `bim2sim` we use direct
input via console for this. But we are also developing a Webtool with proper
frontend that will allow to make the decisions with direct usage of an inbuilt
viewer.

Made decisions can be stored between projects to make the usage more efficient.

For more detailed information please have a look at the code documentation
of [decisionhandler](decisionhandler) and [decision](decision)
