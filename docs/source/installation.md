# Installation

## Anaconda
As some requirements for inbuilt plugins of bim2sim are not available via PyPi 
but only via Anaconda, the best way to install bim2sim is using conda.

`conda install bim2sim -c # todo`

if all worked well you should be able to start using bim2sim. Try

`python bim2sim -h`

to see all available commands. For further reading see [](First_steps).
