# PluginLCA

The PluginLCA is used to export the material quantities and their cost groups
according to DIN276. Its the most basic Plugin currently.
The result are two .csv file that hold information about the used materials
quantities in volume and mass and lie the foundation for a later analysis with
LCA databases. We are planning to automate this link so a complete automated LCA
can be carried out based on the IFC data.
