  abstract = {Future weather scenarios significantly affect indoor thermal comfort, influencing people's well-being and productivity at work. Thus, future weather scenarios should be considered in the design phase to improve a building's climate change resilience for new constructions as well as renovations in building stock. As thermal comfort is highly influenced by internal and external thermal loads resulting from weather conditions and building usage, only a dynamic building performance simulation (BPS) can predict the boundary conditions for a thermal comfort analysis during the design stage. As the model setup for a BPS requires detailed information about building geometry, materials, and usage, recent research activities have tried to derive the required simulation models from the open BIM (Building Information Modeling) Standard IFC (Industry Foundation Classes). However, even if IFC data are available, they are often faulty or incomplete. We propose a template-based enrichment of the BPS models that assists with imputing missing data based on archetypal usage of thermal zones. These templates are available for standardized enrichment of BPS models but do not include the required parameters for thermal comfort analysis. This study presents an approach for IFC-based thermal comfort analysis and a set of zone-usage-based templates to enrich thermal comfort input parameters.},

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are an essential tool for indoor airflow simulations and in the design process of energy-efficient buildings. Setting up CFD models typically demands considerable manual effort, including the modeling of geometry, defining boundary conditions, and meshing. This complex and labor-intensive process can be streamlined by automatically generating indoor CFD models from IFC-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) models. To integrate this CFD model setup in an existing tool, a plugin for the IFC-based multi-domain bim2sim simulation environment with the open-source CFD library OpenFOAM was developed, including automated meshing and refinements. As the accuracy of simulation results highly depends on the mesh quality, the mesh must satisfy specific quality criteria. Furthermore, balancing a sufficiently detailed solution provided by finer grids and reasonable runtimes is a persistent challenge in CFD. This paper presents algorithms for automatic IFC-based mesh refinement for interior elements like radiators and air terminals. These algorithms are evaluated by refinement studies and a mesh quality analysis in a case study of a single office. The proposed optimal grid refinements can be used in further research to automatically set up CFD simulations for IFC-based thermal comfort analysis.},
